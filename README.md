# Multi-Language MkDocs Project Management

This project provides a set of command-line tools to manage multi-language MkDocs projects efficiently. It allows you to create, configure, and manage multiple MkDocs sites within a single project directory.

## Overview

> **Note:** This project is actively under development. Features and functionalities may change as improvements are made.

Our philosophy for organizing multi-language MkDocs projects is to treat each language version as an individual MkDocs site. This approach allows for independent management of each language while maintaining a unified structure under a single main directory. Each language-specific MkDocs site resides in its own sub-directory at the same hierarchical level, as illustrated below:

```
/website-project/      # Main Project Directory
├── mk-website_en/     # MkDocs site in English
│   ├──docs/
│   ├──mkdocs.yml
├── mk-website_fr/     # MkDocs site in French
├── mk-website_de/     # MkDocs site in German
...
```

With this mindset, we developed a tool to facilitate the management of these sites. The tool organizes them within a single directory structure, enhancing maintainability, flexibility, and ease of installation. The structure includes shared resources and configurations, as shown below:

```
/website-project/      # Main Project Directory
├── mkdocs-lang.yml    # Configuration file for mkdocs-lang
├── mkdocs.yml.template # Template YAML for MkDocs
├── requirements.txt   # Shared requirements for all MkDocs sites
├── venv/              # Shared virtual environment for all MkDocs sites
├── mk-website_en/     # MkDocs site in English
│   ├──docs/
│   ├──mkdocs.yml
├── mk-website_fr/     # MkDocs site in French
├── mk-website_de/     # MkDocs site in German
...
```

> **Note:** The `mkdocs-lang.yml`, `mkdocs.yml.template`, `requirements.txt`, and `venv/` are auto-generated by the tool and can be customized by the user to fit specific project needs.

This structure allows for centralized management of all language-specific MkDocs sites, making it easier to synchronize files, manage configurations, and perform Git operations.

## Commands

### Create a New Project

Initialize a new MkDocs multi-language project directory.

```bash
mklang newproject --project /path/to/new/project/website-project --github <github-account>
```

### Add a New MkDocs Site

Add a new MkDocs site to your project by cloning a Git repository.

```bash
mklang addsite <url-repo> --project <path-to-main-project> --lang <language-code>
```

### Create a New MkDocs Site

Create a new MkDocs site within your multi-language project setup.

```bash
mklang new <mkdocs-site> --project <path-to-the-mainproject> --lang <language-code>
```

### Remove a MkDocs Site

Remove an existing MkDocs site from your project.

```bash
mklang removesite <site-name> --project <path-to-main-project>
```

### Copy Files or Folders

Copy a file or folder across all MkDocs sites within your project.

```bash
mklang copy <source-path> [relative-path] --project <path-to-main-project>
```

### Delete Files or Folders

Delete a file or folder across all MkDocs sites within your project.

```bash
mklang del <target-path> [relative-path] --project <path-to-main-project>
```

### Run Custom Commands

Execute a custom command across all MkDocs sites within your project.

```bash
mklang run "<the-customized-command-line>" [relative-path] --project <path-to-main-project>
```

## Organizing Multi-Language MkDocs Projects

This toolset is designed to streamline the management of multi-language documentation projects using MkDocs. By centralizing configuration and automating repetitive tasks, it simplifies the process of maintaining consistent and up-to-date documentation across multiple languages.

### Key Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Automate the setup and management of multiple MkDocs sites.
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniform configuration and styling across all language sites.
- **Scalability**: Easily add or remove language sites as your project grows.

This approach is ideal for projects that require documentation in multiple languages, providing a structured and efficient way to manage content across different locales.

For more detailed information on each command, refer to the documentation files in the `docs/` directory.

## Installation

To install this tool, you need to clone the repository and use `pip` to install it locally. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:TechxArtisanStudio/MkDocs-Lang.git
   cd MkDocs-Lang
   ```

2. Install the package using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

This will make the `mklang` command available for system-wide CLI usage.
