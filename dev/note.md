for all actions, the first step is to check the current path of where the command line is called if inside of a mkdocs webiste, which mean, it need to use the method in utils.py to traverse up to the root and find for cat mkdocs-lang.yml. if there is not 'mkdocs-lang.yml' found, `--project` have to be specified. Do we need to write this logic in each actions python script, or we can just do it only one check in manage.py?
